Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection Project Synopsis Report: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Introduction Credit card fraud detection is crucial for protecting customers and financial institutions from unauthorized transactions. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on anonymized data.

Objectives Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Handle highly imbalanced datasets. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics. Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, sklearn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Key Concepts and Tools Credit Card Fraud Detection: The process of identifying unauthorized transactions to prevent financial loss and protect cardholders. Imbalanced Dataset: A dataset where the number of instances of one class significantly outnumbers the instances of other classes. In this project, fraud cases are the minority class. Resampling Techniques: Methods such as oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class to balance the dataset.

Dataset Dataset Description: Transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Contains 284,807 transactions over two days, with 492 identified as frauds. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with frauds accounting for 0.172% of transactions.

Conclusion This project demonstrates how to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. By handling imbalanced data and utilizing resampling methods, the project ensures accurate detection of fraudulent transactions. Completing this project enhances your skills in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using Python.
